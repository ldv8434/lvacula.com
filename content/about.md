## The Person

Heya, I'm a guy who likes tech. My background is mostly in computer security with a focus on the IT/networks side of things rather than the programming side. However, I do a lot of automation and hobby projects with Python. 

## The Site

There's a proverb in tech: "nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution". Sometimes it’s your “temporary fix” cron job to clear out caches instead of adding more storage. Sometimes it’s the quick setup server that you put in place to hotfix one that crashed. Either way, you end up seeing it years later and go “*that’s* still being used?”.

I couldn’t think of a blog name and nearly named it “temp”. Then I realized that I was falling right into that trap. May as well own it.
