About a year ago, I started working for a new company. 
This was a major shift for me as I'd gone from being a fully-remote penetration tester with a focus on Windows to an on-site systems engineer with a focus on Linux.
This post is some of my thoughts on the change, and things I've learned about my work and myself in that time. 

- I *really* enjoy being a Linux admin more than a Windows admin. 
I prefer the tooling and being able to do most of my work over SSH.
- I need to have some kind of project tracking like a kanban board so that I don't get lost in a list of 700 tasks. 
- I can learn a *lot* through hands-on work and troubleshooting. 
I already kind of knew this one but not how *much* I could learn. 
A year ago, I had never heard of Satellite and Ansible was something I used in a class one time. 
Today, I'm the SME for Satellite at the company and leading our Ansible Automation Platform deployment project. 
- Red Hat has wonderful people working for them. 
Everyone I've met on sales calls, in workshops, and at the Summit has been a pleasure to talk to.
- It is so much fun having Linux nerds to talk to who aren't developers. 
That's not a jab against developers, but there is a difference between a Linux nerd who mostly talks about programming new drivers and a Linux nerd who knows how to write Systemd unit files. 
- I *loathe* driving into an office. 
I had an hour-long commute each way for most of the past year.
It was a huge waste of time, energy, and (gas) money.
- I also strongly dislike *being in* an office. 
I never felt unsafe or anything, but I never felt comfortable either. 
- Basic `vim` usage is worth it to learn. 
I originally did so because `nano` wasn't available on all of the servers I was managing. 
I continue to use it as my default because it feels a little more ergonomic than the alternatives. 
- Ansible is incredibly satisfying. 
There's nothing quite like going from base installation to a working service in 2 minutes with one command.
- There are plenty of tricks and tools that I have no idea about yet but will change the way I work as soon as I learn them. For example:
    - `bash`'s `Ctrl-r` to do a substring search on history instead of tapping the up key a bunch
    - `at` to schedule one-off commands
    - Everything related to Ansible

I may add to this post as I think of more.
