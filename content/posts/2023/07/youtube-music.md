A funny thing I’ve noticed about YouTube Music: it doesn’t seem to take your recently-listened-to music into account when showing quick recommendations if you have YouTube history turned off. I can listen to as much blues or j-rock as I want, but it doesn’t start showing those as quick recommends until I hit the like button on a track. Unfortunately, this also means that things I liked a while ago don’t appear anymore.
