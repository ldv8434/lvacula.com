I decided that I was done with Gitea's weird port mapping, so I tried to fix it. 
Several hours of head-bashing later, I was left with a corrupted database and no Gitea instance.

I'm now writing this several hours *after that*. 
I've learned a surprising amount about Podman (compared to Docker), Kubernetes, pods, and several other things that I'll probably end up using at work some day.

Expect a post some time this week about deploying a Zola static site with Jenkins.
And maybe some notes on why I switched from Wordpress to Zola.
