I didn’t really agree with statements about Google’s search getting worse until today.

Using search would usually give me what I wanted within the first few results. All I’d need to do was skip past the inevitable Amazon link that would show up.

But for the past few days, I feel like I’ve had more and more “junk” in it.

- Links that look like they are for a specific post on a forum, but take me to the main page instead.
- Links for blogs that look like they were written by an AI.
- Links that go to entirely different websites than those they appear to be for.

It’s admittedly tiring and makes me want to restart my habit of bookmarking more sites.
