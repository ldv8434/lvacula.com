I'm finally giving Vi[m] a try. It's hard to get used to it after using `nano` for so long. Surprisingly, it's not the `:wq` or insert mode stuff that is catching me, but the fact taht I can't go to the previous/next ling by pressing left/right at the line ends. 

(Yes, I realize I can modify this in the .vimrc file but I'm attempting to keep it as close to default as possible since I work on so many different systems.)
