Finally doing something that I should have done a long time ago – adding a second (and in some places, first) backup to my systems. BorgBase won over rsync.net for price, and over Backblaze B2 for ease of use with Borg. Bonus points for also making my GUI of choice – Vorta.

Additionally, I’m automating as much as possible with Ansible. I still loathe YAML for configuring anything, but Ansible nearly makes that worth it. ;p
