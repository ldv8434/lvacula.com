Late night thought before work maintenance: I don’t particularly enjoy WordPress’ writing interface. It doesn’t feel suitable for quick or technical writing. Customizing the site feels like fighting against the tool.

Pelican (the static site generator) felt a lot nicer. Writing in markdown feels much nicer than using Gutenberg or the Classic Editor (plus I can do version control with Git!) and .html.j2 files for customization is easier than WordPress’ syntax. I’m hardly a Python dev – I don’t wanna be a web dev too.
