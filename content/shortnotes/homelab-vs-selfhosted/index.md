I don't look at Reddit that often since they changed the API rules. On the rare chance that I do look, it's usually either r/homelab or r/selfhosted. The two subreddits are practically the same with lots of focus on Linux, containers, etc... You often find people in r/selfhosted talking about learning and testing things, and people in r/homelab threads about what people are hosting. 

I have to wonder if changing r/selfhosted to r/homeproduction would help at all.
