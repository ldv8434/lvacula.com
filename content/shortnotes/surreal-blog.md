I found a blog by someone who works at a polar research station. [Their post on nights](https://brr.fyi/posts/polar-night) there is surreal. It reminds me of Signalis.

EDIT: I realized while porting this post to Zola that I posted this on Halloween. It wasn't my intention to match that with a horror game reference, but it fits! :D
