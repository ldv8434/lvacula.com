I'm trying out the new FSRS scheduling algorithm for Anki.
I was hesitant to use it when it was first announced because it seemed to be undergoing a lot of fast changes and required a fair amount of manual setup.
But now it's in the main Anki code (though not in AnkiDroid, yet) and it seems like a poor idea to *not* use it.
