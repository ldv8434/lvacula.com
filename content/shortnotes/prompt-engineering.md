A small realization just came to me: there’s a certain irony to “prompt engineering” being something that people try to teach as if it’s a programming discipline. Wasn’t the goal of the natural language models to make it so that people can speak normally and get the output they want? Shouldn’t that mean that “prompt engineering” should be the same as a communications or writing class?
