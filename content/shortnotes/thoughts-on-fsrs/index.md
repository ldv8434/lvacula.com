I've been trying FSRS for about a month now. Here's my thoughts on it so far:
- I feel like I have a more manageable workload. However, part of me wonders if this is because I'm not putting all of my effort into studying a cert or a language. 
- I don't think about how my choices are affecting the ease factor anymore. 
- The 3-component model is a lot easier to understand than SM-2's ease.
- I wish I had been studying more during the Fall. My stats page isn't reliable because my Anki usage was very sparse for most of 2023. 
- Some of the intervals for relatively new cards feel very long. I'm not sure what to make of this. I'll probably need to reflect on this again in a few months 
- Even with the helper add-on to auto-reschedule cards on sync on desktop, I still feel disincentivized to use Ankidroid due to lack of native support.
- It has been a very positive experience overall.
