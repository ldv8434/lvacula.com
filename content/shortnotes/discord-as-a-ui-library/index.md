One annoying problem I have with learning something new programming-wise: 
I'm so familiar with the Discord.py API library that any *real* UI library feels like it has too much friction to be worth it for any of my projects.
It's even cross-platform!

I'm torn between freshening up my PyQt, learning Kotlin + Android dev, or looking into something else for Linux/Windows dev...
