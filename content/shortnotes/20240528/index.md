I've been rebuilding my homelab using Fedora Rawhide + Ansible. It's a nice mix of the kind of stuff I use at work and the bleeding-edge updates I prefer for home use. The goal is to have something that can be rebuilt 100% from Ansible. 

Of course, I'm making it harder on myself by aiming for an OKD setup...
